I wasn't able to complete the frontend within the given timeframe.
I attempted to minimize the creation of similar components, 
which unfortunately led me to spend a considerable amount of time trying to make the initial idea work. 
Eventually, I had to salvage what progress I could because there wasn't enough time for a complete refactoring.

If you're interested in exploring the frontend, I've ensured that the search and get user endpoints are connected appropriately. 
Feel free to take a look at your convenience.
